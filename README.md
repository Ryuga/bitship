### This project will allow you to deploy your python/node application to dokku easily from a web interface

### Features
- one click deployment 
- no additional configurations 
- build to work with both dokku and heroku
- build in CMS


### Release notes:

Project is still under development so some features may not work/would require bug fix. 
Dokku daemon handler API is still under early stages of development so the code is still not open source.
It will be made open source once all the features are implemented and tested, currently the project works with the 
latest private release of the dokku deployment handler and supports heroku platform API out of the box
